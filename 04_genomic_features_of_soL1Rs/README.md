# Genomic Features of soL1Rs

This directory contains data and scripts to describe the genomic features of soL1R insertion sites

## Genomic distribution of soL1Rs

If you have a list of soL1Rs (or any variants) with the information of genomic coordinate, you can draw the distribution of variants across the genomic regions in 10 Mb sliding windows with 5-Mb-sized steps. 

```bash
./draw_genomic_distribution ${input_bed}
```
